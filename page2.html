<p style="font-size: 26px;">More days after finishing reading the book, it has made me change some things about how I see life. First of all, we are very fortunate to have a loving family everyday, caring for us and loving us each and every day. Take, for example, the boy. He had no one but his father. And even later, his father, unfortunately, passed away. Also, we are fortunate to have lunch provided to us by our school everyday. The boy and his father had to constantly look for food within the road, filled with many dangers. The man and the boy also were in constant fear for their safety on the road, with the man always holding a loaded gun. As for us students, at school, even though some areas experience shootings, we should be glad that we are protected and have many security measures for our well-being. Appreciate where you are, because there’s someone who’s living a lower life than you.

<p style="font-size:26px;">Hey! If you've made it this far I'd like to thank you for reading my website. Haha. I hope it was a fun experience reading my website.</p>
<p style="font-size:26px;">Initially, I came up with this idea because I wanted to get back into HTML, the programming language that I used to write this website. This book was really a banger for me. Really. The entire story. The ending shook me the most emotionally. I knew from the second that I picked this book that it would be very enjoyable. As for me, I really enjoy programming, so that's also why I combined my logic side with my literature side (the book) for this project.</p>
<p style="font-size:26px;">But anyways, thank you for reading, and I'm out!</p>
