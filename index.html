    <p style="font-size:26px;">In “The Road” by Cormac McCarthy, there is a recurring theme to never give up, no matter what the circumstances. No matter the struggles. If you give up, it’s over. 
    Along the road, the father and his son, who are both unnamed, come across many resources when they are in the lowest part of their journey, left over by dead civilians. One example of a surplus of resources obtained is the bunker (page 138). Before the bunker, they were already low on their food supply, but they were granted a trip to heaven with the bunker and its resources, filled with food, water, etc. On page 279, the father is about to die due to his worsening injury and chronic cough while the boy is kneeling by his side. In their last conversation, the father tells the boy to never give up, the theme that is constantly visible throughout the entire story.

<h1 style="color: red;">Post-reading Thoughts</h1>
<p style="font-size:26px;">As for my thoughts after reading the book, it is a very wholesome and emotional book. The son and his father stood strong until the end, when the father died and the young child was forced to move along without him. This part of the story was very sad and emotional for me, as the father, who cared for his dear son this far, for so long, is now to part from his son. At times, it seemed like it was over for both of them, but they were able to persevere through and survive the desolate road until the father’s end. Looking back at the book, what made me pick out this book in the first place was its dark exposition. Living in a post-apocalyptic society, the father and his son must manage to roam the road while being wary of possible dangers, such as others along the road or a decreasing food supply. If you haven’t already, I would highly recommend this story. Many themes are explored, including the relationship between father and son as well as the major theme of gathering hope and persevering through obstacles.
